Choose number of pendulums
Define IC's
	- Drag and drop pendulum nodes
	- Lock individual IC's(l_1,theta_1,l_2,theta_2,...) with a checkbox
	- IC menu scales with n
Colours are interpolated n times through RGB or something
Nodes are all black? Maybe just a black outline
Plot(matplotlib)
	- Real time
	- Any coordinate(x,y,theta) by any coordinate(x,y,theta)
